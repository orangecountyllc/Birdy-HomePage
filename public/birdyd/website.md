The primary reason why you dont have best customer service with ride shaer is bc the driver isnt  getting paid enough. 


If turned on - App automatically send the vehicle info to ur parents /  friends 
if you have not reached the destination within specific time... 
ur friends get all the location tracking  live and after  drive is finished!!! 

Parents can motior the live app. ie location etc.


> Allow feature for women to drop them off a block away from their destination. 
So dont show the house number to the drivers. 

OUR APP tracks if the driver's  hasn't driven away or he is staynig there, and even ask the driver to move away!!!! 

> Say on website most of our drivers are UBer / Lyft drivers who have min 10 years of experience.  Wiht us they are happy make more money. 

> If the riders who proivde their ID to the platform we will prioritize those rides bc our drivers will feel safe!!!!  ( Maybe add this feature LATER )
